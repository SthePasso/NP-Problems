For a course covering P, NP, and NP-hard problems, we can design a structured curriculum that explains these concepts progressively, with an emphasis on classical NP-hard problems. Here's a course outline and the suggested lecture titles:

### **Course Title**:  
**"Understanding P, NP, and NP-Hard Problems: Foundations and Classical Challenges"**

### **Course Overview**:
This course introduces the concepts of P, NP, and NP-hard problems, focusing on computational complexity, decision problems, and real-world NP-hard problems. By the end, students will understand these concepts and how NP-hardness relates to problems in computing, algorithm design, and optimization.

### **Lecture 1: Introduction to Computational Complexity**
- **Topics**: Basic concepts of computational complexity, time complexity, big-O notation, polynomial-time algorithms.
- **Goal**: Establish the foundational understanding of problem classification based on complexity.

### **Lecture 2: Classifying Problems – P vs NP**
- **Topics**: Definition of P (Polynomial time), NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time), NP-completeness.
- **Goal**: Differentiate between problems solvable in polynomial time and those verifiable in polynomial time.

### **Lecture 3: Reductions and the Concept of NP-Completeness**
- **Topics**: Polynomial-time reductions, Cook-Levin theorem, the significance of reductions in NP-completeness.
- **Goal**: Introduce the idea of reductions as a tool to classify problems.

### **Lecture 4: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
- **Topics**: TSP formulation, NP-hardness, approximation algorithms for TSP.
- **Goal**: Explore TSP as one of the most famous NP-hard problems, and show how it relates to real-world routing problems.

### **Lecture 5: The Knapsack Problem**
- **Topics**: 0/1 knapsack problem, fractional knapsack problem, dynamic programming solutions, and NP-hardness.
- **Goal**: Study the knapsack problem and demonstrate its applications in resource allocation and finance.

### **Lecture 6: The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)**
- **Topics**: CNF-SAT, 3-SAT, the Cook-Levin theorem, and NP-completeness of SAT.
- **Goal**: Understand SAT as the first problem proved to be NP-complete, and its importance in complexity theory.

### **Lecture 7: The Vertex Cover Problem**
- **Topics**: Definition of vertex cover, NP-hardness, approximation algorithms, real-world applications in network security.
- **Goal**: Analyze vertex cover and how it models network-related problems.

### **Lecture 8: The Subset Sum Problem**
- **Topics**: Formulation of the subset sum problem, NP-completeness, dynamic programming for small instances.
- **Goal**: Present subset sum as a fundamental NP-complete problem and demonstrate its use in cryptography.

### **Lecture 9: The Graph Coloring Problem**
- **Topics**: K-coloring, chromatic number, NP-hardness of graph coloring, and applications in scheduling and register allocation.
- **Goal**: Show the difficulty of assigning resources (colors) subject to constraints in real-world scenarios.

### **Lecture 10: P vs NP – The Million Dollar Question**
- **Topics**: The open question of whether P equals NP, its implications for computing, cryptography, and AI.
- **Goal**: Discuss the significance of solving the P vs NP problem, current approaches, and why it’s crucial for the future of computing.

This course structure covers fundamental theoretical concepts and provides hands-on experience with classical NP-hard problems. You can also include coding exercises to solve small instances of these problems and use approximation algorithms or heuristics to handle larger instances.
